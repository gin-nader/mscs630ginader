Tom,

- Good job in creating your accounts!

- Good job in setting up your java compiler in your system.

- Good job with your first GitHub submission!


However,

- Although the assignment is in the specified folder, the repository in general
  is not properly organized. 'proposal' should be in a 'prj' folder, for
  example.



Peace,

- Dr. Pablo Rivas
